## How to execute the project
- To run the project you'll need to follow the steps bellow:
    1. Inside of the project root, run `npm install` to install the dependecies of the api. 
    2. Still inside of the project root run `npm run seed` to create the database.
    3. Now, you go to path Angular/teste_rtb and there you run `npm install` to install the dependecies of front-end.
    4. For finish, open to diferents terminals, one in the project root (responsible for the api), and another in the path Angular/teste_rtb (responsible for the front end). Furthermore, in the first one you'll run `npm run start`, and the second you'll run `npm start'.
